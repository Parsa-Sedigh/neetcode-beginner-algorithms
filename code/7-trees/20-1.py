# T: O(n) where n is the size of the tree or number of nodes. We visit every single node once.
# M: O(h)


# The time complexity of the inorder traversal algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
# This is because the algorithm traverses each node exactly once, performing constant time operations at each step.

# The memory complexity of the algorithm depends on the maximum depth of the function call stack during the
# traversal. In the worst-case scenario, where the binary tree is skewed to one side (essentially forming a linked
# list), the depth of the call stack would be equal to the number of nodes in the tree, leading to a memory
# complexity of O(n). However, in a balanced binary tree, the depth of the call stack would be proportional to the
# height of the tree, which is O(log n) for a balanced binary tree. So, the memory complexity can be stated as O(h),
# where h is the height of the binary tree.
